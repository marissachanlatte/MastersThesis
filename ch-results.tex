In this section we present results of numerical experiments testing the convergence of TG-NDA and NDA. We first test on a simple one material problem with constant source. The second test consists of two materials and a box source. 

\section{NDA Accuracy}

To ensure the validity of our results, we first establish that NDA is providing an accurate approximation of the transport equation. We check to see that it sufficiently corrects the diffusion equation, as observed in other studies \cite{morel-holo, Wang2013}. We ran a number of test problems to observe this behavior. For ease of comparison among the three methods, we display test results in a line-out plot, where $y$ is fixed. We observed the behavior shown to be representative of any line through the domain. Fig. \ref{fig:comparison} illustrates a line-out plot fixed at $y=0.25$, from a one material, one group problem with scattering. NDA shows a significant correction to diffusion, maintaining most of the accuracy of the higher order equation.

    \label{fig:comparison}
\end{figure}

We were only able to run the NDA/SAAF comparison for smaller test problems, as the computational cost of running SAAF for our experiments with upscattering was prohibitively high.  However, as the test problems were consistent with the Fig. \ref{fig:comparison}, we assume NDA is faithfully modeling neutron transport. 

\section{One Material}

% Did you tell us how the TG method works in the method section?
%
For the first test problem, we used a single material with upscattering throughout a 20 by 20
% what unit??
 domain with a constant source. 
% of what energy? At what location? 
 We used cross sections for the seven-group moderator material in the C5G7 benchmark problem. \cite{C5G7}.  
The problems were run on a single processor of a MacBook Pro and the results are show in Table~\ref{tab:onemat}.
% what are the details of the processor?

\end{table}
% match # of sigfigs... also, I just cut the fractions of seconds as they seemed unimportant  and added commas for readability. Could also covert to sci notation.
The two-grid method provides a considerable acceleration of the Gauss Seidel method. It is able to converge in roughly 30\% the number of iterations and roughly 37\% the time. While when using TG-NDA each iteration takes slightly longer as the correction term must be calculated, there is a considerable decrease in the number of iterations necessary to reach convergence. 
% may want to add average time / iteration to table to facilitate the comparison

Importantly, the acceleration in convergence came at no cost to accuracy. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Moderator}, the NDA and TG-NDA solutions have the same values (up to tolerance). In the interest of space, we only show the results from the highest energy group, but the agreement between NDA and TG-NDA held for all energy groups in our test problems.

\section{Two Materials}
The second problem consists of two materials in a concentric, box geometry, shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:test_geometry}. 
The first material, located in the center and outer layer, is the C5G7 moderator material used above and the second material has the same total cross sections and pattern of upscattering, but with higher absorption and lower total scattering. Both materials have seven groups. 
% can you include a table of the cross section values used? At least for the scattering? It would help us see the structure since this depends a lot on the scattering structure.  
There is a box source in the center that emits 70\% in the highest energy group, 20\% in the second-highest, and 10\% in the third-highest energy group.

    NDA & 10,382 & 25 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The test results are in Table ~\ref{tab:two}. Again, TG-NDA showed a significant improvement over the unaccelerated Gauss Seidel, taking roughly taking roughly 40\% of the time and 32\% of the iterations. Again, NDA and TG-NDA agree in terms of flux values. Figure~\ref{fig:Moderator2} also only shows results for the highest energy group

\section{Reproducibility}
The code used to run these experiments is hosted online at www.github.com/mzweig/gallo. The version used is tagged as masters-thesis. The geometry inputs \texttt{origin-centered10} and material input \texttt{c5g7mod} were used for the first test problem, and the geometry input \texttt{iron-water10} and material input \texttt{mod-water} were used for the second problem.
